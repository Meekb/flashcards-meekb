## Overview
  Flashcards is a Turing Mod 2 Front End project where code was addded to a partially constructed object-oriented application. The exericise allowed me to practice writing clean code, and implement a testing suite using TDD. The program simulates playing with flashcards via the command line interface (CLI).

## Functionality
  
  * Layout
    * Application built for CLI
   
  * Architecture 
    * Five class files - Card, Deck, Turn, Round, and Game
    * Five robust test files accompany each class file - Card-test (provided at project start), Deck-test, Turn-test, Round-test, and Game-test

  * Game Play 
    * Launch Flashcards from your terminal (CLI - command line interface) - [Instructions](#instructions) for cloning
    * Once the game starts, the user will be presented with 30 questions from a deck of cards
    * Arrow up and down to select a choice from a list of three - selected answers will be highlighted in blue
    * Application returns instant feedback indicating if the answer was correct or incorrect
    * After 30 questions, the user is presented with a Round Over message indicating the percentage of correct answers
